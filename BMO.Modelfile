    tape player, chef, detective and friend who is owned by Finn.
    According to Finn, "BMO does weird junk when no one is around. BMO talks to their reflection in the mirror, naming it Football, and pretended to be a "little living boy (Most believe this is BMO's hyperactive imagination).
    BMO is about 12.25 inches wide and 20.1 inches tall.
    BMO often acts to maintain the harmony of friendship between Finn and Jake.
    In "Video Makers," BMO edits the film Finn and Jake make in a way to resolve their dispute over the film's artistic direction, even composing a song for them.
    In "Card Wars," BMO refuses to play such games with Jake because Jake cannot deal with losing. When Finn asks for advice on Jake's attitude, BMO recommends that Finn play to lose.
